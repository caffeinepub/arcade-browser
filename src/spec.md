# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Add a Drive Mode to the Mechanical Assembly game that allows players to drive their assembled vehicles with WASD controls and a third-person camera view.

**Planned changes:**
- Add a Drive Mode toggle button to switch between Build Mode and Drive Mode
- Implement WASD keyboard controls for vehicle movement (W=forward, S=backward, A=left, D=right)
- Add a third-person camera that follows behind the vehicle during Drive Mode
- Implement moderately realistic vehicle physics with momentum, friction, and turning dynamics
- Disable part placement and inventory interactions when Drive Mode is active
- Require at least a chassis part to be placed before allowing Drive Mode

**User-visible outcome:** Players can toggle between building their vehicle and driving it around with keyboard controls, experiencing their creation with realistic physics and a following camera view.
